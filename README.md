# Avalonia to-do list tracker and visualizer 1.0

Welcome to my to-do list, made in avalonia!

This application features complex task management,
with subtask, prerequisites and begin times and internal/hard deadlines.

You can use regular and pomodoro timer for your work. Also, some very basic statistics
are included to keep you motivated.

## Supported platforms

As of now, this application should be runnable on Windows, Linux and macOS. Mobile devices are not supported as of now,
even though it could potentially work.

## Prerequisites

First, you need to install .NET SDK 9, as this application is not yet deployed.

You can find it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0). Just install any version, but make
sure that it is SDK.

## Install and run

After installing .NET SDK 9, you can download this project. You can do so through `git clone`, or you can simply 
click code -> Download source code -> zip (or other). Then navigate to the `AvaloniaToDoListTrackerAndVisualizer` folder,
where you should be able to open the terminal and input `dotnet run`. Your .NET SDK 9 will compile it and run it.

I plan to update the app in the future. After that happens, there will be another section on how to update your app, without losing your data.

Stay tuned!
